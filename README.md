# unsupervised-machine-learning-challenge
# Part 2: Apply Dimensionality Reduction
# There is no distinct cluster for TSNE model
# Part 3: Perform a Cluster Analysis with K-means
# Based on the above plot, there is no K value for the Elbow Curve
# Part 4: Make a Recommendation
# Based on current data, TSNE and K-Means Models shows that there is no clear movement trend in TSNE and no sign of elbow curve in K-Means value.
# Bigger Dataset and to split the data into Test and Traning to test above models and others should have a more accurate predictions and clustering.
